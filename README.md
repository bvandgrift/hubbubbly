Hubbubbly
=========

_"What's the hubbub, bub?"_

Hubbubbly is designed for local interest groups, providing a curated set of events, news items, and
a directory of interested people.  We refer to the collection as a Hub.  

_Who's it for?_

Anyone involved with an interest group who wants to establish a central reference point for
getting information out.

_Such as?_

The project was started to support the CLT-area tech groups: startup groups, user experience,
ruby, functional programming, founders--there is a lot of overlap between these groups, and
there was no central place one could go to see the various tech events scattered around the
area.  Hubbubbly was conceived to provide a primary point of reference.

_No, it's not a blog_ and its article creation facility is primitive.  It's an information depot, a
Hub around which an interest group can rotate.
